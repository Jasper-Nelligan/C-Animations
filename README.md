# C-Animations

A C program that creates text animations on the command line. It contains four animations for you to enjoy! I made this for fun and as review for my upcoming CSC 360 course, which uses C. Some coding concepts used here were string-number conversion using atoi, 2D string arrays, and using XOR for flipping boolean values.
